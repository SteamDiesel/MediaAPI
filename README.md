# Media API (for KingKai.org)
This is the server side API back end for kingkai.org, built on Laravel with Nova as the content manager.

## project constraints
This project was delivered in an extremely compressed timeline (under a week for both API and front end) so speed of delivery was prioritised over best practice for future extensibility of the platform. 

_it's not fair to judge me for by the quality of this project_
